In a world where we're striving for that "Pinterest Perfect" photo or Snapchat worthy selfie, seldom do we embrace imperfection. I'm just as guilty as the next person. Or at least, I was, until one early summer day last year when I was struck with the idea that maybe, just maybe, the pursuit of perfection wasn't serving me, not at all.
